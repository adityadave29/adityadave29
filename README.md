# About Me:
Hello, I am Aditya Dave, an M.Tech student at IIIT Bangalore. I am exploring web development, machine learning, and core computer science concepts.

![Krishi Yojana Setu](https://github.com/adityadave29/krishi-yojana-setu) is an ongoing project (as of **December 2025**) aimed at building a **centralized platform** that serves as a one-stop solution for information related to government agricultural schemes (Krishi Yojanas).

### Problem Statement

Currently, farmers need to visit **multiple government websites** to find updates about new agricultural schemes and subsidies. Even after discovering a scheme, understanding its **eligibility criteria, benefits, required documents, and application process** is often difficult and unclear. This fragmented access to information results in confusion and missed opportunities for many farmers.

Krishi Yojana Setu addresses this problem by bringing all relevant scheme information together on a **single, easy-to-use platform**.

### What This Platform Offers

The platform is designed to provide:
- A comprehensive list of **active and previously active agricultural schemes**
- Well-structured information including **eligibility criteria, benefits, timelines, and application procedures**
- **Advanced filtering options** to help users quickly find schemes relevant to their needs

### Current Project Status

As of now, the following features have been implemented:
- Backend APIs for **admin registration**
- APIs for **adding and managing scheme details**

Currently, scheme data is being added **manually**, as there are no official public APIs available to fetch data directly from government portals. In future phases, the project aims to implement **automation and data ingestion mechanisms** to keep scheme information updated efficiently.

### Contributions

This project is open to collaboration. Contributors can:
- Propose and implement **new features**
- Improve and **refine existing functionalities**
- Assist with **automation, UI/UX enhancements, testing, or documentation**

Feel free to fork the repository, raise issues, or submit pull requests.
